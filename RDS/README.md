## RDS Performance Insights
* Visualize your database performance and analyze any issues that affect it
* With the Performance Insights dashboard, you can visualize the database
load and filter the load:
..* By Waits => find the resource that is the bottleneck (CPU, IO, lock, etcâ€¦)
..* By SQL statements => find the SQL statement that is the problem
..* By Hosts => find the server that is using the most our DB
..* By Users => find the user that is using the most our DB
* DBLoad = the number of active sessions for the DB engine
